iTaiko
======

It's in essence a portable instrument for Taiko No Tatsujin ( 太鼓の達人 ) lovers.

If you want to play along when you see a video like [this][cool_vid], then I'm glad 
to tell you I have started this project to make this possible.

If you find there're some missing features, feel free to do a feature request by opening a new issue ;)
